Hello my young friend, this system was specially designed to help raise funds for travel by a large company, and this tool can also be a good motivator because it can be used to see the progress of all participants in the trip in real time.  I hope my efforts are not in vain, your Dev.  Friend!  .

Installation
------------

* Upload all files to the server.
* Open index.php file find line 86 (mysqli_connect) and —Åonnect to database.
* Import the myfriend.sql database.


Documentation
-------------
This system is not safe; it lacks any checks during data processing. This sample is an example of bad work without using OOP and ignoring any design rules. I would even consider it a joke. Implement a separate handler and validate all data.
* Realize your security yourself
